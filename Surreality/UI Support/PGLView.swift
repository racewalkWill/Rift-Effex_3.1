class PGLView: UIView {
//    The view requires a MTLDevice object so that it can create and manage Metal objects internally.
//    Your app must set the device and, optionally, modify the view’s drawable properties before drawing. The MTKView class supports three drawing modes:
//
//    The default mode automatically invokes a redraw based on an internal timer.
//    In this case, both isPaused and enableSetNeedsDisplay are automatically set to false.
//
//    The second mode invokes a redraw from a view notification, which is usually a call to setNeedsDisplay().
//    In this case, both isPaused and enableSetNeedsDisplay must be set to true.
//
//    The third mode invokes a redraw when the draw() method is explicitly called.
//    In this case, isPaused must be set to true and enableSetNeedsDisplay must be set to false.
//
//    For all of these drawing modes, when a redraw is requested, either draw(_:) from a subclassed instance of the view is called,
//    or draw(in:) from the view’s delegate is called.
//    You should either subclass MTKView or provide a delegate, but not both.
